# FG_CAR_GAME

Pelle Brun

Unity 2022.3.8f1 <DX11>


The game is intended to start to a menu with a Start and Exit button, clicking the Start button will present 3 other buttons for the 3 different maps, clicking any of those buttons should take you to the right map where the game will instantly begin. You drive a car by pressing W and S to go forward and backwards respectivly and you turn by pressing A and D to turn the car left and right, during the race you will drive through 5 hidden checkpoints and after driving through them all 3 times you will win the race, where you will be presented by a textbox stating that you won and a button to retry which will take you back to the start menu. You can at any time during a race press M to open a pause menu where you can click to Continute the game or Exit the game

To dissect the project I recommend to start in the StartingScreen Scene, but the game should work as intended even if you start in any of the other scenes. I downloaded Adressables and the New Input System, They were both used in extreme low meassure for me as an introduction to try and learn them. The new input system was quite annoyong to get to work and even then I could not figure out how to make a Hold down like function for moving which caused me to not want to work on this project which wasted a lot of time that I could have used on other things.

I am somewhat pleased with how I wrote the code for this project but I also feel like I should have spend a lot more time on it. 

The main helpers for this project was Unity docs as that was everything I used
